## Environment for using Mu-PRO

The setup for using Mu-PRO instead of developing it is much simpler. 

### Server software
For the server software, we just need intel mpi which can be installed following instructions [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit-download.html?operatingsystem=linux&distributions=aptpackagemanager).
